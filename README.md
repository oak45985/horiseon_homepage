# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Refactor Code for Horiseon Homepage

### Assignment was to refactor code for Horiseon Homepage.

This included properly indenting of HTML language, addition of "alt" attributes for images ("title" for hero), and semantic re-naming of elements within the HTML file.

### Other fixes

• Some nav (ID) links fixed.
• CSS file properly commented (making entirety of file easily legible).
• CSS file reorganized as to cascade correctly.

### Questions

Are image "alt"s useful for vector-based, logo/icon type objects?
